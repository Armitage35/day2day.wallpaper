# Day2Day.wallpaper
## Object and objective
Chrome OS is a great OS but is greatly lacking when it comes to handling wallpaper and that is a letdown. Day2Day.wallpaper aims at fixing this with the help of our friends over at Unsplash.

## Features
As its core, the main goal of Day2Day.wallpaper is simply to let its users browse, find pictures to use as their new wallpaper. A more detailed list of features is soon going to make its way here.

As we're all about ChromeOS it will be distributed over to Chrome's webstore.

## Tech and stack
The application will be built with ReactJS and won't require any backend. If that were to change, we would use Node, Express and MongoDB (reg MERN stack).
